This site was previously hosted on a wordpress instance when I was first starting out in IT. This was the last snapshot from archive.org [About Us](http://bringinghomebachmann.com/index.php/about/) from 2018-08-27.

We are Patrick & Kristin Bachmann from Alabaster, Alabama. We met at the University of Alabama in 2009 and instantly became best friends. We got married in 2013 and now settling into our new home. Kristin is a Event Sales Manager while Patrick is a Network System Administrator for the Federal Court System. We have two fur babies Beau & Chance! Together, we enjoy Alabama and Birmingham Southern football games, time at the lake or beach and lazy Sundays.

Obviously quite a bit has happened since then and I'll eventually get around to writing a proper update.
